## User Story

```md
AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
```

## Node Packages

To install packages, prior to running the application server or client, install the develop and non-develop depend by running the command npm run install. This would install both client and server dependencies.
